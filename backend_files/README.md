## Backend Files (backend_files/)
This folder contains the Python files for the FastAPI backend. However, these files are not actually used for hostingâ€”they are just here for reference so people can see the code.

The actual backend is deployed on Google Cloud, and this folder is simply a copy of the working backend files. Any updates to the backend are made directly on the cloud deployment, not in this folder.

# NLP-Powered arXiv Paper Dashboard & Explainer

This project is an NLP-Powered arXiv paper dashboard and explainer designed to help researchers and enthusiasts find and analyze the most interesting AI research papers.

Built with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, the system fetches papers from the arXiv API, ranks them based on relevancy, authorship, and a Gemini-generated paper score, and provides AI-powered summaries and interactive chat functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Fetch AI Research Papers**
  Retrieves papers from arXiv and ranks them based on:
  - **Relevancy of topics and authors**
  - **A paper score generated by Gemini**, based on relevance, insightfulness, novelty, and impact.
    
- **Daily & Weekly Top Papers**
  Displays the **top AI papers of the day and week** based on ranking.
  
- **Real-Time Paper Updates**
  Scrapes the arXiv recent submissions section to ensure the latest research is available.
  
- **AI-Powered Summaries**
  Uses **Gemini API** to generate concise markdown-formatted summaries for quick insights.
  
- **Direct Paper Access**
  Provides a **direct link to the original arXiv paper**.
  
- **Chat About Paper**
  Enables an **interactive chat** using:
  - **Gemini API** for LLM responses
  - **OpenAI embeddings with FAISS index** for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
  - **Persistent conversation context**, maintaining previous questions and answers with a **cutoff** to optimize relevance.

## Usage

### Browsing and Summaries

- Users can browse **top daily and weekly AI papers**, as well as the most recent research.
- Each paper includes a **Gemini-generated markdown summary** for quick reading.
- A **direct arXiv link** is available for full paper access.

### Interactive Chat with Papers

- Users can **ask questions** about a paper, and the system retrieves the most relevant sections using **FAISS-based vector search** before querying **Gemini** for an AI-generated response.
- The **chat retains context**, maintaining previous interactions with a cutoff to optimize responses.

## Future Plans
- **Enhance paper ranking**: Improve topic-based ranking with NLP analysis, could add subcategories within AI (biotech, NLP, robotics, etc.)
- **Expand multi-modal capabilities**: Incorporate figure/table extraction.
- **Add user-based recommendations**: Personalized suggestions based on reading history.
- **Add news dashboard**: Add a similar dashboard for top AI news, scraping from top tech companies' blogs and news api's.
